# Customized-Chrome-Extension
Created a Google Chrome Extension that hosts my personal links such as my GitHub, Linkedin, Website, and Twitter. 

I used Visual Studio Code as the text editor. I used HTML5 for the content and structure. I used CSS3 and Bootstrap's modal component for the design and user notification. I also used JavaScript for the functionality. I then used Adobe Photoshop to create the icon logo for the Google Chrome Extension icon.
