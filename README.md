# Customized-Chrome-Extension
Created a Google Chrome Extension that hosts my personal links such as my GitHub, Linkedin, Website, and Twitter. 

I used HTML5 for the content of the extension. I used CSS3 and Bootstrap for the design and look of the extension. I then used Adobe Photoshop to create the icon logo for the Google Chrome Extension.
